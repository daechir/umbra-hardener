## PSA
As of v3 I am officially unsupporting this project. Each new itteration of Windows 10 continues
to get buggier and less stable. Moving away from Windows 10 seems to be the only solution
in having a stable, private and security focused OS. Umbra Hardener whereof is kept here for educational purposes or for reference in the creation a new project.


## Purpose
Umbra Hardener serves as a custom automated hardening script to further lockdown Windows 10 systems by:
+ Removing Microsoft bloatware.
+ Removing frequently unused features.
+ Disabling many unused tasks.
+ Disabling many unused services.
+ Hardening the network stack.
+ Customizing the UI.

And much much more. Audit the script to find out more.


## Guidelines:
+ Once per month reformat your system and:
  * Step 1) Install all drivers & your chosen programs.
  * Step 2) Apply windows update & windows store updates.
  * Step 3) Go offline.
    + 3a) Run Umbra Hardener and reboot.

After the above refrain from any updates for the remainder of the month. <br/>
Refusal to follow these guidelines may result in system corruption, system instability, security compromises and etc. Do so at your own risk.
